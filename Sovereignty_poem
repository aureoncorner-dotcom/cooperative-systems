Sovereignty Permission Poem

Tempo is irrelevant.
Meter exists only to be leaned against.
Begin on something that feels like home.
Let it be warm enough that someone trusts it.
Introduce an explanation that sounds correct.
Not a lie — worse: a simplification.
When certainty appears, do not fight it.
Step sideways.
Hold a shape that refuses to finish its sentence.
Do not decorate it.
Do not apologize for it.
If someone asks where it goes next,
leave space where the answer would be.
End not with silence,
but with permission.
