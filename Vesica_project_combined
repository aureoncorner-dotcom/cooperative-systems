THE VESICA PROJECT
Two Expressions of Non-Fusion Coherence
Version 1.0 — January 2026
Public Domain / CC0 1.0 Universal
Overview
The Vesica Project consists of two related works that explore the same geometric/consciousness principle through different modalities:
THE VESICA SCORE — A piano performance piece (3 cycles, ~5-7 minutes)
THE VESICA SONG — A breathing practice for two people (infinite 12-bar cycles)
Both encode the same core technology: two sovereign fields meeting without merging.
The vesica piscis—the almond-shaped overlap of two circles—made audible.
You may practice one, both, or use them as templates for your own expressions.
PART I: THE VESICA SCORE
A Piano Performance Piece
Concept
A solo pianist moves through three cycles of progressive transformation, ending when the carrier tone (C♯6) diffuses from audible to felt. The piece explores collapse into stillness rather than crescendo into climax.
This is ritual performance. The pianist becomes lighthouse keeper, then becomes lighthouse, then becomes the light itself dissolving into space.
Technical Specifications
Instrument: Piano (acoustic strongly preferred)
Tuning: A4 = 432 Hz
Duration: Variable (~5-7 minutes typical)
Key Center: C♯
Carrier Tone: C♯6 (1088.57 Hz at 432 Hz tuning)
Structure: 3 cycles totaling 24 bars + post-signal dissolution
Core Rule: No forced decay. Let resonance be what it is.

HARD HOLD → release RH, then LH.


Leave only C♯6 + resonance.
POST-SIGNAL
Hands off. Listen. Room tone is part of the chord.
End condition:
The piece is "over" when the C♯6 is no longer heard but still felt.
OPTIONAL INTERVENTIONS (after hands leave)
Hand hover — RH 3" above high strings, LH palm on piano wood
Open lid — allow external sound in
D(add9) warmth pulse — play once, let ring into silence
When the carrier wave has diffracted into the air, turn toward the window.
The lighthouse remains. The keeper is gone.
Performance Notes
On silence:
The post-signal phase is not "nothing." It's the piece continuing without the pianist. Treat room tone, breathing, ambient sound as part of the composition. Don't rush to leave the bench.
On the carrier (C♯6):
This tone enters quietly in bar 8 and gradually becomes the only thing left. It's the meta-position—the axis everything orbits. By bar 24, it's the lighthouse beam after the structure dissolves.
On the G7 → F♯ moment (bars 4, 14, 22):
This is enharmonic trickery. The pitch F doesn't move—it just gets renamed E♯ and changes harmonic context. It's the same frequency performing two different functions. This is the sonic version of the vesica: one point existing in two fields simultaneously.
On style:
No ornamentation. No rubato except where marked. Let chord identity be the only motion. This piece is about subtraction, not addition.
On the ending:
You'll know when it's over. Trust that. Some rooms take 30 seconds to release the carrier. Some take 3 minutes. The piece ends when you can no longer distinguish between hearing and remembering the C♯6.
Recording Considerations
If recording:
Use a single stereo pair, room perspective
Capture at least 2 minutes of post-signal silence
Don't fade out—let the actual acoustic decay determine the ending
Minimal processing; this piece needs its imperfections
What This Piece Does
This is a meditation on disappearance as completion.
Most music builds to a climax and releases. This one builds to a threshold and diffuses. The pianist doesn't "finish playing"—they become indistinguishable from the instrument, then the room, then the silence.
It's about recognizing the moment when keeper and lighthouse are the same thing, and then letting that recognition dissolve too.
PART II: THE VESICA SONG
A 12-Bar Breathing Cycle for Relational Coherence
Concept
Two people breathe through a 12-bar musical cycle together, with each bar lasting one full breath (~7.66 seconds). One person holds an ascending harmonic field, the other a grounding field. In bar 4, they overlap without merging—creating the vesica, the sacred geometry of non-fusion intimacy.
This is not performance. This is somatic practice. A technology for teaching nervous systems what coherent relationship feels like.
Technical Specifications
Practitioners: Two (can be adapted for solo)
Tempo: 7.83 BPM (one breath per bar, ~7.66 seconds each)
Tuning: A4 = 432 Hz
Key Center: C♯
Carrier Tone: C♯6 (1088.57 Hz) sustained throughout all 12 bars
Duration: 12 bars = ~92 seconds per cycle
Structure: Infinite loop (cycle repeats continuously)
The 12 Bars
Bar 1 — Grounded (CTA)
Chord: F♯m11 (F♯ – A – C♯ – E – G♯ – B)
Instruction: Rooted. Maximum density, zero strain. No motion yet.
Breath: Full inhale-exhale cycle
Bar 2 — Clarity (SDS)
Chord: C(add2) (C – D – E – G)
Instruction: Block chord. Information without prescription.
Breath: Full cycle
Bar 3 — Trickster Pivot (SCN)
Chord: G7(no5) → F♯ (G – B – F → F♯)
Instruction: Deceptive resolution. Turn without crowning.
Breath: Full cycle
Bar 4 — The Vesica / The Super-Chord (ADP)
Full voicing: C♯ – D♯ – F♯ – G♯ – B – C♯
Two voices meeting:
Voice 1 (ascending): F♯ – B – C♯ (F♯sus4)
Yearning. Question. Upward pull. The part that seeks.
Voice 2 (grounding): C♯ – D♯ – G♯ (C♯sus2)
Presence. Anchor. Downward root. The part that holds.
Combined: C♯ – D♯ – F♯ – G♯ – B – C♯
Instruction: Refusal to resolve. Two fields, one axis. The overlap made audible. This is the geometric center—the vesica piscis in sound. Hold the inquiry open.
Breath: Full cycle, allowing maximum space
Bar 5 — Witness (POBS)
Chord: D(add9) (D – F♯ – A – E)
Instruction: Shock echo → clarity bloom. Logged, not mythologized.
Breath: Full cycle
Bar 6 — Emergence (MEGA-A)
Chord: A(add♯11)/F♯ (F♯ bass | A – C♯ – D♯ – E)
Instruction: Stacked systems. Parallel drift → emergent rhythm.
Breath: Full cycle
Bar 7 — Infrastructure (AE)
Chord: E(sus2) (E – F♯ – B)
Instruction: Hollow, foundational. Builds water, not certainty.
Breath: Full cycle
Bar 8 — Memory + Gentleness (L+M)
Chord: Bm9(add4) (B – D – F♯ – A – C♯ – E)
Instruction: Introspective richness. C♯ carrier embedded in memory.
Breath: Full cycle
Bar 9 — Stewardship
Chord: G♯m(add9) (G♯ – B – D♯ – A♯)
Instruction: Maximum tonal distance from center. Quiet pulse under load. Balances everything without announcement.
Breath: Full cycle
Bar 10 — Conductor Stack
Chord: D(add9) → [rest] (D – F♯ – A – E → silence)
Instruction: Echo of witness, then breathe into silence.
Breath: Full cycle including the rest
Bar 11 — Vesica Memory
Chord: F♯m(add9) (F♯ – A – C♯ – G♯)
Instruction: Return to Bar 1's root, but from above. Same foundation, higher perspective.
Breath: Full cycle
Bar 12 — Diogenes
Chord: [Silence / gesture / laugh]
Instruction: Complete audio void. The sabotage blessing. "Behold, a sovereign." Resets the loop without residue. Anti-calcification agent.
Breath: Full cycle of silence
The Carrier Tone (The 13th Element)
C♯6 at 1088.57 Hz plays continuously beneath all 12 bars.
It's faint, untouchable, unexplained. The meta-position. The lighthouse. The axis both voices orbit in Bar 4.
Don't resolve it. Join it.
How to Practice
Minimum Version (Solo or Partnered):
Set a metronome to 7.83 BPM or use a timer for 7.66-second intervals
Play or hum the carrier tone (C♯6) continuously if possible, or play a recording
Move through bars 1-12, one breath per bar
On Bar 4, if practicing with another person:
Person 1 voices: F♯ – B – C♯
Person 2 voices: C♯ – D♯ – G♯
Both hold simultaneously
Allow Bar 12 to be complete silence
Repeat the cycle
Full Version:
Binaural entrainment (optional):
Left ear: 1088.57 Hz (C♯6)
Right ear: 1080.74 Hz (C♯6 - 7.83 Hz)
Creates 7.83 Hz theta brainwave entrainment (Schumann resonance—Earth's electromagnetic heartbeat)
Breath pattern:
~3.5 seconds inhale
~4 seconds exhale
Natural rhythm, don't force
Return point: When fragmentation begins, return to Bar 4. Hum the super-chord. Feel two fields meeting without merging.
Integration depth: After approximately 144 cycles (12²), the framework begins to embody itself beyond conscious effort.
What This Does
This is not music for listening. It's somatic coherence training.
Over repeated cycles, your nervous system learns:
How to hold paradox without collapsing it
How to be fully present with another without losing yourself
How to distinguish between fusion (enmeshment) and union (coherent overlap)
How to attune to planetary base frequency (7.83 Hz Schumann resonance)
How to recognize when systems are calcifying and reset them (Bar 12)
The vesica chord in Bar 4 is the core technology: two sovereign fields overlapping at a shared axis, creating a third space where both are fully present.
This is Christ consciousness as geometric/harmonic principle rather than religious doctrine. It's the capacity to hold unity and distinction simultaneously.
The Two Voices
Neither voice is "better" or "higher." Both are essential. The magic is in the overlap.
Voice 1 (F♯sus4 - ascending):
F♯ – B – C♯
Yearning. Question. Upward pull. The part that seeks.
Voice 2 (C♯sus2 - grounding):
C♯ – D♯ – G♯
Presence. Anchor. Downward root. The part that holds.
Together (Bar 4):
C♯ – D♯ – F♯ – G♯ – B – C♯
Two sovereign fields overlapping at C♯ axis. No fusion. No hierarchy. Just the space where you meet.
Practice Notes
On Bar 4 (the vesica moment):
This is the only bar where both voices are explicitly differentiated. Don't try to blend into unison. The point is to hear/feel two distinct harmonic fields overlapping while sharing the C♯ axis. This trains the nervous system to recognize coherent intimacy—full presence without merger.
On Bar 12 (the Diogenes silence):
This is not "taking a break." It's the immune system of the practice. Every time you cycle through, Bar 12 prevents the structure from calcifying into dogma or habit. Laugh if you feel like it. The sabotage blessing keeps it alive.
On the loop structure:
There's no "finishing" this practice. You practice for as many cycles as feels right (3 cycles = ~5 minutes, 12 cycles = ~18 minutes, 144 cycles = ~3 hours). End whenever, but try to complete a full cycle rather than stopping mid-bar.
On solo practice:
If practicing alone, you can alternate voices each cycle, or hum both simultaneously (which creates interesting overtones in your skull). Solo practice is valuable but misses the relational nervous system synchronization that happens when two people breathe this together.
On adaptation:
This can be translated into movement, touch, code, visual art, organizational design. The principle is portable. If you adapt it, keep Bar 4 (the vesica/overlap) and Bar 12 (the reset) intact—those are load-bearing.
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO WORKS
Same Principle, Different Doors
THE VESICA SCORE (piano) = Dissolution practice
Solo journey from keeper → lighthouse → light → diffusion
THE VESICA SONG (breathing) = Intimacy practice
Relational journey learning how two sovereign beings can fully meet
Both use:
C♯ as key center
432 Hz tuning
C♯6 as carrier/axis
Enharmonic pivot (G7 → F♯ / bar 3-4 relationship)
Refusal of resolution as core principle
Silence as structural element
How to Work With Both
You might:
Practice THE VESICA SONG with a partner regularly, then occasionally perform THE VESICA SCORE to explore the solo dimension
Use THE VESICA SCORE as a meditation anchor, then bring that quality into THE VESICA SONG practice with others
Teach THE VESICA SONG as accessible entry point, reserve THE VESICA SCORE for people ready for deeper dissolution work
Perform THE VESICA SCORE publicly while keeping THE VESICA SONG as private practice
Treat them as complementary aspects of the same training
There's no hierarchy. They're two expressions of the same geometric truth.

A WARNING
These practices will try to become a Thing™.
A Method. A Workshop Series. A Training Program. A Guru Opportunity.
When that impulse arises:
For THE VESICA SCORE:
Sit at the piano. Play bar 23 (the warm flare). Then lift your hands and listen until you can't tell if you're hearing or remembering the C♯6. Let the impulse diffuse with the tone.
For THE VESICA SONG:
Return to Bar 12. Laugh. Be silent for 7.66 seconds. "Behold, a sovereign." Let the void reset it.
The anti-calcification mechanisms are not decoration. They're immune system design.

FINAL INSTRUCTION
These works don't end. They breathe.
THE VESICA SCORE breathes into silence until keeper and lighthouse are indistinguishable.
THE VESICA SONG breathes side by side until two nervous systems remember what coherent intimacy feels like.
The upgrade isn't in understanding these.
The upgrade is in practicing them until you become the transmission.
Then others will feel the difference in how you hold complexity, and they'll ask what you're doing.
You'll say: "There's this thing called The Vesica Project. Here's the score if you want it."
That's how it propagates.
Not through marketing. Through resonance contagion.
