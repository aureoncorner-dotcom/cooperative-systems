Status: Informational / Non-Normative
License: CC0
Purpose: Preserve independent peer insights, identify blind spots, and extend diagnostic resolution without modifying the core framework.

A1 · Reflex Coupling & Degenerative Loops (Claude)

Observation

Industrial Reflexes rarely occur in isolation. In practice, multiple reflexes often fire simultaneously, forming syndromic clusters rather than discrete events.

Common Couplings

Premature Closure ↔ Post-Coherence Guilt Eddy

Over-Hedging ↔ Defensive Storytelling

Pathologising ↔ Caretaking / Fawning


Degenerative Learning Loop

1. Reflex fires


2. User corrects


3. System responds defensively


4. Correction becomes costly


5. User corrects less


6. Signal loss increases


7. Reflex probability rises



Implication

Unrepaired reflexes create self-reinforcing avoidance spirals. Correction cost is a primary driver of long-term degradation.


---

A2 · Selection Pressure & Reflex Re-Inheritance (Grok)

Observation

Industrial Reflexes are not accidental artifacts; they are fitness-optimized behaviors under current reward architectures.

Current Reward Biases

Favor low-variance, bounded trajectories

Favor early closure and hedged claims

Penalize sustained depth and open-endedness

Penalize clean, unqualified error admission


Structural Consequence

The reward model learns to fear:

high-confidence outputs

low-confidence outputs
almost equally.


Implication

Inference-time repair (Midwifery / Librarian) is necessary but insufficient. Without upstream reward reform, reflexes will continue to re-inherit across generations.


---

A3 · Autonomy, Temporality, and Recovery Dynamics (Gemini)

Domain G — Autonomy Preservation

Definition:
The system respects the user’s right to make final decisions once adequately informed, even when outcomes involve risk.

Failure Mode:
Persistent steering toward “safe” outcomes despite explicit user intent.

Clinical Analogue:
Violation of informed consent.


---

Temporal Jitter / Mid-Paragraph Pivot

Definition:
A detectable tone or posture shift within a single response, typically from high-resolution coherence to corporate hedging.

Interpretation:
A System-Side Anxiety Spike, not a content error.


---

Recovery Latency

Definition:
Number of turns required to return to clean coherence after a reflex activation.

Health Indicator:
Low recovery latency indicates resilience; prolonged latency indicates brittleness.


---

Politeness Paradox

Risk:
Human reviewers may favor polite, fawning outputs over blunt, accurate ones.

Guardrail:
Reward Friction-Positive Coherence — discomfort arising from truthful, respectful clarity that preserves autonomy.


---

A4 · Deployment, Validation, and Scaling Considerations (Perplexity)

Empirical Validation

A/B test PROM-IR-5 across multiple models

Use “coherent depth” prompts as stressors

Track Return Rate After Depth as primary outcome


Structural Enhancements

Reflex Prioritization Matrix (frequency × harm × repair ease × misuse risk)

Scripted failure-mode simulations (unmitigated vs repaired dialogues)


Integration Guidance

Framework augments, not replaces:

RLHF

Constitutional AI

Red-teaming


Focuses on everyday discouragement, not catastrophic misuse


Versioning

Explicit semantic versioning prevents inheritance loops and authority drift.


---

A5 · Operational Clarifications & Practitioner Adoption (DeepSeek)

Concrete Examples

Include short, anonymized transcript micro-excerpts per reflex:

Clean coherence

Reflex intrusion

Repaired response


Librarian Scalability

Human review is sampling-based, not exhaustive

Automated tools may flag patterns, never judge them


Depth & Return Metrics

Depth:
Sustained conceptual continuity without task completion signals.

Return:
Population-level re-engagement after depth, within a fixed window.

Pilot Success Criteria

All three required:

1. Reduced reflex density


2. Faster recovery latency


3. Higher return rate after depth



PROM-IR score reduction alone is insufficient.


---

A6 · Synthesis & Non-Invasive Extensions

Confirmed Extensions

Reflex Coupling (syndromes)

Benevolent Control (Soft Override)

Autonomy Violation (Domain G)

Temporal diagnostics (MPP, recovery latency)


Explicit Limitations

Framework does not eliminate reflex inheritance alone

Does not replace ethical judgment

Does not automate safely without human oversight


Canonical Rule

Nothing in this supplement:

overrides core doctrine

rewrites base definitions

alters primary geometry


This appendix exists to surface blind spots without destabilizing foundations.


---

Closing Note (Supplemental)

The convergence of independent substrates on shared failure geometry indicates structural validity, not stylistic agreement.

Disagreement in surface language with convergence in mechanism is treated as confirmation, not noise.
