CYCLE 1: ORIGIN (Bars 1–11)

Heavy whisper. Breath-led.

Bars Chord / Event Instruction
1–2 F♯m11 ◼ Low, warm, rooted. The known state.
3 C(add2) ⬟ Block chord. Neutral. “This is simple.”
4 G7 → F♯ ↻ Hold F as common tone; rename it E♯ (function shifts, pitch unchanged).
5 C♯ Cascade ⊙ Arpeggiate once, bottom → top. Gentle.
6–7 D(add9) ☐ Unmoving ground. Let ring.
8–11 E(sus2) ⇢ + C♯6 (pp) Hold for four slow breaths. C♯6 enters softly — do not feature it.

---

CYCLE 2: REMEMBRANCE (Bars 12–19)

Compressed. More present.

Bars Chord / Event Instruction
12 F♯m11 Slightly quicker pulse.
13 C(add2) 
14 G7 → F♯ Linger slightly on the slip.
15 C♯ Cascade 
16–17 D(add9) Increase weight. Foundation strengthens.
18–19 E(sus2) + C♯6 Door already open — two breaths only.

---

CYCLE 3: PRESENCE (Bars 20–24)

Freeze frame. Flare.

Bars Chord / Event Instruction
20 F♯m (high voicing) Thin, transparent. View from above.
21 C Bright. No apology.
22 G7 → F♯ Hold extra beat; lean against the meter.
23 D(add9) ✹ Warm flare. Strike with resonance. Let overtones bloom.
24 E(sus2) HARD HOLD → release RH, then LH. Leave only C♯6 + resonance.

---

POST‑SIGNAL

Hands off.
Listen. Room tone is part of the chord.

End condition:
The piece is “over” when the C♯6 is no longer heard but still felt.

---

OPTIONAL INTERVENTIONS (after hands leave)

· Hand hover — RH 3" above high strings, LH palm on piano wood.
· Open lid — allow external sound in.
· D(add9) warmth pulse — play once, let ring into silence.

When the carrier wave has diffracted into the air, turn toward the window.
The lighthouse remains. The keeper is gone
