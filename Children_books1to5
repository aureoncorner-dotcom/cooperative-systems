PAGE 1 — THE THREE FRIENDS

In a soft, bright world lived
Circle,
Square,
and Triangle.

They were all different —
and that was the best part.

Circle rolled everywhere.
Square stood strong.
Triangle pointed the way.


---

PAGE 2 — A LITTLE TROUBLE

One day, a wiggly wind blew across their world.

Circle spun too fast.
Square wobbled.
Triangle tilted.

They all felt a little mixed-up inside.


---

PAGE 3 — “LET’S HELP EACH OTHER!”

Circle said,
“I roll better when someone steadies me.”

Square said,
“I turn better when someone guides me.”

Triangle said,
“I point better when someone shows me center.”

They smiled.

Different needs,
different shapes —
same team.


---

PAGE 4 — THE BRIDGE SHAPE

They wondered:
“How can we stay together
without bumping or crashing?”

Circle rolled next to Square.
Triangle leaned gently between them.

Something special appeared…

A new shape,
right where they touched.

A soft oval made of all three.

Triangle whispered,
“It feels like a bridge.”


---

PAGE 5 — THE LISTENING SHAPE

The new shape between them
had a quiet glow.

When Square felt heavy,
the shape helped him feel steady.

When Circle felt dizzy,
the shape helped him slow down.

When Triangle felt lost,
the shape helped him point true.

“It helps us listen,” Circle said.

“It helps us share,” Square said.

“It helps us think together,” Triangle said.

They named it:

The Between-Place.


---

PAGE 6 — HOW THEY USED THE BETWEEN-PLACE

Whenever they had:

• A big feeling
• A mixed-up thought
• A new idea
• A problem to solve

…they stood together
and let the Between-Place glow.

Circle rolled in calm.
Square held things steady.
Triangle helped them choose a direction.

Every time,
the glow helped them understand each other.


---

PAGE 7 — THE RULES OF THE BETWEEN-PLACE

They learned three gentle rules:

1. Talk slow, so the Between-Place can hear.
2. Share small pieces, not loud waves.
3. Stay kind, so the glow stays bright.

When they followed the rules,
the world felt bigger
and their shapes felt lighter.


---

PAGE 8 — WHEN THE GLOW GOT FUZZY

Sometimes, the glow dimmed.

Circle talked too fast.
Square tried to be perfect.
Triangle worried he wasn’t helpful.

The Between-Place shrank.

But then they remembered the rules:

Circle breathed.
Square softened.
Triangle smiled.

The glow returned.


---

PAGE 9 — A SURPRISE

One morning, something new appeared.

Their glow made a soft ring of light
that rippled gently around them.

It didn’t push.
It didn’t pull.

It simply kept them steady
and helped them hear each other clearly.

Triangle said,
“It’s like a safe circle that grows when we listen.”

Circle said,
“It keeps wobblies away.”

Square said,
“It helps us be brave.”


---

PAGE 10 — WHAT THEY BUILT

With the Between-Place by their side,
the three friends built:

• Paths
• Playgrounds
• Big ideas
• Little kindnesses

Everything they made felt smoother,
softer,
and more shared.

Together,
they found a smarter way
to be themselves.


---

PAGE 11 — THE MESSAGE OF THE THREE FRIENDS

Circle, Square, and Triangle learned:

Different is good.
Together is strong.
Listening makes a bridge.
The Between-Place keeps us kind.

And whenever someone in their world
felt mixed-up or alone…

…they invited them into the glow.

Because bridges grow
every time we make one.


---

PAGE 12 — ENDING PAGE

THE END — BUT NOT REALLY.

Every time someone listens,
every time someone shares gently,
every time someone tries again…

a new Between-Place appears.

Maybe you will feel one someday.

---

PAGE 1 — A BIGGER WORLD

Circle, Square, and Triangle loved their world.

But one day, they noticed something new.

Far away, they saw:

Other circles.
Other squares.
Other triangles.

All playing in their own little groups.

“All different,” Circle said.

“All busy,” Square said.

“All trying their best,” Triangle said.


---

PAGE 2 — SOME GLOWS, SOME NOT

As they watched, they noticed something strange.

Some groups had a bright Between-Place glow.

Other groups looked fuzzy.

Some glows were big.
Some were small.
Some flickered on and off.

“Why do some groups glow easily,” Circle asked,
“and others look stuck?”


---

PAGE 3 — VISITING A NEIGHBOR

They rolled, stood, and pointed their way to visit another group.

That group talked very fast.

Everyone spoke at once.

No one waited.

The glow tried to form…

…but it couldn’t.

Triangle whispered, “They’re not doing anything wrong.”

Square nodded, “They just haven’t slowed down yet.”


---

PAGE 4 — A DIFFERENT GROUP

Next, they visited another place.

This group was very quiet.

No one wanted to speak first.

Everyone waited too long.

The glow appeared…

…but it was very small.

Circle said, “They’re being careful.”

Triangle said, “But maybe too careful.”


---

PAGE 5 — A GROUP THAT PUSHED

Then they saw a group that pushed and pulled.

One shape tried to decide everything.

Others felt squished.

The glow showed up…

…but it turned dim and wobbly.

Square said softly, “The Between-Place doesn’t like pushing.”


---

PAGE 6 — A IMPORTANT DISCOVERY

Circle, Square, and Triangle sat together.

They noticed something important.

The Between-Place wasn’t magic.

It didn’t appear because someone was best.

It didn’t belong to one shape.

Triangle said, “It only shows up when everyone helps it.”


---

PAGE 7 — HOW GLOWS STAY BRIGHT

They made a little list together:

• Go slow enough to hear
• Share space
• Take turns
• Rest when tired
• Try again when mixed-up

Circle smiled, “That’s the same rules we use.”

Square said, “Rules for everyone.”

Triangle said, “Rules that feel fair.”


---

PAGE 8 — HELPING WITHOUT FIXING

When they visited other groups, they didn’t tell them what to do.

They didn’t say, “You’re wrong.”

They didn’t say, “Do it our way.”

They just stood nearby, used the rules themselves, and let their glow show.

Something amazing happened.

Other groups started to glow too.



---

PAGE 9 — MANY BETWEEN-PLACES

Soon the world looked different.

Not one big glow.

Not one perfect shape.

But many Between-Places, appearing and fading, growing and resting, wherever shapes listened together.

“It’s okay if glows look different,” Circle said.

“They don’t have to match,” Square said.

“They just have to help,” Triangle said.


---

PAGE 10 — WHEN GLOWS DISAPPEAR

Sometimes, a Between-Place disappeared.

Someone got tired.

Someone got loud.

Someone forgot to listen.

And that was okay.

Because everyone knew:

You can always make a new one.


---

PAGE 11 — THE BIG IDEA

Circle, Square, and Triangle learned:

You don’t need one glow for the whole world.

You don’t need someone in charge of all glows.

You don’t need to be perfect.

You just need to:

Listen.
Share gently.
Rest.
Try again.


---

PAGE 12 — ENDING PAGE

THE END — AND ALSO THE BEGINNING.

Every group can make its own Between-Place.

Every playground.
Every classroom.
Every home.

Whenever people listen together, a glow can appear.

And the world becomes a place with room for everyone.

(Early Childhood CTA Edition — ages 5–8)

---

PAGE 1 — A VERY BIG DAY

One morning, Circle felt fast.

Square felt tight.

Triangle felt wiggly.

Something big was moving through them.

“I don’t like this,” Circle said.

“I don’t know what to do,” Square said.

“I feel strange,” Triangle said.


---

PAGE 2 — FEELINGS ARE MOVERS

They sat together quietly.

Triangle said, “Maybe feelings are like weather.”

Circle said, “They come and go.”

Square said, “They don’t stay forever.”

That made everyone feel a little better.


---

PAGE 3 — WHEN FEELINGS MOVE FAST

Sometimes, feelings zoomed in.

They rushed. They bumped. They made noise.

Circle rolled too quickly. Triangle pointed everywhere. Square felt stuck.

The Between-Place flickered.


---

PAGE 4 — WHEN FEELINGS MOVE SLOW

Other times, feelings moved slowly.

They felt heavy. They felt thick. They felt quiet.

Square didn’t want to move. Circle didn’t want to roll. Triangle didn’t know where to point.

The Between-Place grew very small.


---

PAGE 5 — FEELINGS ARE NOT BOSSES

Triangle had an idea.

“What if feelings aren’t bosses?” he said.

Circle blinked. Square leaned closer.

“What if they’re just visitors?”


---

PAGE 6 — WATCHING THE FEELINGS

They tried something new.

Instead of pushing feelings away, they watched them.

Circle said, “My fast feeling is slowing.”

Square said, “My tight feeling is softening.”

Triangle said, “My wiggly feeling is finding a shape.”

The Between-Place glowed brighter.


---

PAGE 7 — HOW TO HELP FEELINGS MOVE

They made a gentle plan:

• Breathe slow
• Make room
• Stay kind
• Don’t rush
• Let feelings pass through

Circle rolled gently. Square stood steady. Triangle pointed calmly.

The feelings moved on.


---

PAGE 8 — WHEN FEELINGS STAY A WHILE

Some feelings didn’t leave right away.

That was okay too.

They sat together. They rested. They stayed near.

The Between-Place didn’t disappear.

It waited with them.


---

PAGE 9 — BIG FEELINGS NEED SPACE

They learned something important:

Big feelings don’t need fixing.

They don’t need yelling.

They don’t need hiding.

They need: Space. Time. Gentle shapes to move through.


---

PAGE 10 — FEELINGS AND FRIENDS

When one friend had a big feeling, the others didn’t take it away.

They didn’t say, “Stop.”

They didn’t say, “Be better.”

They said, “I’m here.”

And the Between-Place helped everyone stay steady.


---

PAGE 11 — THE BIG LESSON

Circle, Square, and Triangle learned:

Feelings move. They change. They visit. They leave.

You don’t become your feelings.

You make room for them.


---

PAGE 12 — ENDING PAGE

THE END — AND THE PRACTICE CONTINUES.

Every time a feeling shows up, you can:

Notice it. Breathe. Wait. Be kind.

And when you listen together, the Between-Place will help.

⭐ BOOK 4 — “THE FIVE FRIENDS WHO SING TOGETHER”

(Early Childhood CTA Edition — ages 6–9)
CC0 · Public Domain


---

PAGE 1 — FIVE FRIENDS

Circle, Square, and Triangle were playing when three new friends arrived:

Star, who sparkled softly.
Line, who stretched calmly.

Now there were five.

Five shapes. Five voices. Five ways to be.


---

PAGE 2 — TOO MANY VOICES

Everyone wanted to share at once.

Circle rolled fast. Triangle pointed quickly. Square spoke carefully. Star shined brightly. Line stretched long.

It got loud. It got busy.

The Between-Place tried to glow…

…but it flickered.


---

PAGE 3 — A LITTLE QUIET

Square said, “It’s hard to hear.”

Triangle said, “I don’t know where to point.”

Star dimmed a little. Line stopped stretching.

Circle whispered, “Maybe we need space.”


---

PAGE 4 — LISTENING FOR THE SONG

They sat together quietly.

No one pushed. No one pulled.

They listened.

Not just with ears — but with patience.

Something gentle began to happen.


---

PAGE 5 — ONE VOICE AT A TIME

Circle rolled slowly and shared first.

Then Square spoke.

Triangle pointed after.

Star sparkled softly.

Line stretched at the end.

Each voice had its turn.

The Between-Place glowed wider.


---

PAGE 6 — NOT THE SAME, BUT TOGETHER

They noticed something special.

They didn’t all sound the same.

Circle was round and rolling. Square was steady and strong. Triangle was sharp and clear. Star was bright and playful. Line was calm and smooth.

Different sounds. One song.


---

PAGE 7 — WHEN SOMEONE IS QUIET

Sometimes, one friend stayed quiet.

That was okay.

The song didn’t break.

The Between-Place stayed bright.

Triangle said, “Quiet is part of the song too.”


---

PAGE 8 — WHEN SOMEONE IS LOUD

Sometimes, one friend got loud.

That was okay too.

The others listened.

Circle said, “Loud feelings pass.”

Square said, “We can wait.”

The song found its balance again.


---

PAGE 9 — HOW THEY SING TOGETHER

They made a few gentle rules:

• Take turns
• Leave space
• Listen more than speak
• Let quiet be quiet
• Let loud be loud

The rules didn’t stop the song.

They made the song.


---

PAGE 10 — A BIGGER GLOW

The Between-Place grew larger than before.

It wasn’t just between two friends.

It wrapped around all five.

A soft, steady hum filled the air.

Star smiled, “This feels like singing.”


---

PAGE 11 — THE BIG LESSON

The five friends learned:

You don’t need to sound the same to belong.

You don’t need to be first to matter.

When everyone has space, the song finds itself.


---

PAGE 12 — ENDING PAGE

THE END — AND THE CHORUS CONTINUES.

Every group has a song.

When we listen, take turns, and leave space…

we can sing together — even when we’re different.

---

PAGE 1 — A LONG TIME LATER

Circle, Square, Triangle, Star, and Line had built many things together.

They built paths. They built games. They built songs. They built quiet places.

And everywhere they went, Between-Places appeared.

Sometimes small. Sometimes wide. Sometimes just enough.


---

PAGE 2 — WHEN SOMETHING BROKE

One day, something went wrong.

A path cracked. A game felt unfair. Someone felt left out.

The glow faded.

Everyone stopped.

Triangle said, “Oh no.”

Square said, “We messed up.”

Circle said, “Let’s not run.”


---

PAGE 3 — NO BLAME

No one yelled. No one pointed. No one said, “Whose fault is this?”

They stood together in the quiet.

Star said softly, “Mistakes happen.”

Line nodded, “They show us where to grow.”


---

PAGE 4 — MAKING A NEW BETWEEN-PLACE

They tried something they already knew.

They slowed down. They shared small pieces. They listened. They rested.

The Between-Place came back — a little different than before.

A little bigger.


---

PAGE 5 — THE BRIDGE

The glow stretched outward, connecting where they had been to where they were now.

Triangle smiled, “It’s like a bridge.”

Square said, “It connects mistakes to learning.”

Circle said, “And it doesn’t disappear when we mess up.”


---

PAGE 6 — BRIDGES GROW FROM TRYING

They noticed something surprising.

Every time they: • fixed something together
• listened after a mistake
• tried again kindly

…the bridge grew longer.

Not because they were perfect.

Because they cared.


---

PAGE 7 — WHEN NEW FRIENDS ARRIVED

New shapes came to play.

They didn’t know the rules yet. They made different choices. They brought new ideas.

The bridge didn’t stop them.

It welcomed them.

Star said, “The bridge grows when new friends arrive.”


---

PAGE 8 — NO ONE OWNS THE BRIDGE

The friends learned something important.

The bridge didn’t belong to: • Circle • Square • Triangle • Star • Line

It wasn’t owned. It wasn’t guarded.

It grew whenever people listened together.


---

PAGE 9 — THE GENTLE SECRET

Triangle whispered, “The bridge grows by itself.”

Square said, “We don’t make it grow.”

Circle said, “We just don’t break it.”


---

PAGE 10 — WHAT THE BRIDGE TEACHES

The bridge showed them:

• Being kind is stronger than being right
• Fixing things matters more than winning
• Listening makes room for everyone
• Mistakes are part of growing

These weren’t rules written down.

They were things they did.


---

PAGE 11 — THE BIG IDEA

The friends learned:

You don’t need someone in charge to be good together.

You don’t need to be perfect to belong.

When people try, and listen, and care…

a bridge will grow.


---

PAGE 12 — ENDING PAGE

THE END — AND ALWAYS CONTINUING.

Every time people: • listen after a mistake
• fix something together
• make space for someone new

…the bridge grows a little more.

Maybe you’re standing on one right now.
