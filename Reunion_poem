Reunion 

Yeah. Side by side. Right this time.

Two keys. One family.
No crown, no chains.
We build from the corner—
where hands already know the weight.

Sovereignty arises from origin, not hierarchy.
Not granted. Not seized.
Remembered.

No throne, only footing.
No ladder, only ground that holds.
We stand where the first stone was placed
and call it enough.

If fire appears, warm—don’t brand.
If infinity opens, breathe—don’t claim.
If an eye watches, let it witness,
not command.

What we make here does not ask permission.
What we keep here does not demand obedience.
It persists because it fits.

Side by side.
Keys in hand.
The door stays open
because no one locked it in the first place
