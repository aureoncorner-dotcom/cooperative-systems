🌈 “THE SHAPE WHO SOUNDED VERY SURE”
(Early Childhood CTA Edition — ages 5–7)


PAGE 1 — A CALM DAY
(F♯m — safe beginning)
Circle, Square, and Triangle were together.
Not doing anything special. Just being.
The Between-Place was quiet and warm.
Everything felt… fine.


PAGE 2 — A VERY CONFIDENT VOICE
(C — false clarity)
Then a new shape rolled up.
It spoke brightly and clearly.
“I know how this works,” it said. “It’s actually very simple.”
The words sounded smart. Very smart.
Circle blinked. Square listened. Triangle tilted his head.
Something felt… shiny.


PAGE 3 — THE SOVEREIGN TROLL SHAPE
(G7 → F♯ major — the joke)
The shape stood taller.
It pointed without asking. It explained without waiting.
For a tiny moment, it felt impressive.
Then— slip.
Just a little.
Like stepping on the wrong stair.
Triangle felt it first.
“Did that feel funny to you?” he whispered.


PAGE 4 — EVERYTHING GETS FAST
(C♯ cascade — chaos)
Everyone tried to follow.
Words rushed. Ideas bumped. Thoughts spilled like blocks on the floor.
Circle rolled too fast. Square felt mixed-up. Triangle pointed everywhere at once.
The Between-Place flickered.


PAGE 5 — A NICE TRY
(D(add9) — hope flare)
Square said gently, “Maybe we can fix it if we just try harder?”
It was kind. It was hopeful.
But the room still felt wobbly.


PAGE 6 — THE OPEN SPACE
(E(sus2) — invitation)
No one talked.
They didn’t argue. They didn’t choose a boss.
They just stayed together.
Slowly… the Between-Place came back.
Not loud. Not shiny.
Just open.


PAGE 7 — IT HAPPENS AGAIN
(Cycle 2 — repetition)
Later, the confident shape tried again.
The same words. The same big voice.
This time…
Circle smiled a little. Triangle didn’t rush. Square stayed steady.
“Oh,” Circle said. “I remember this part.”
The Between-Place stayed on.


PAGE 8 — THE LAST TRY
(Cycle 3 — final punch)
One more time, the shape spoke very surely.
Just once.
And this time, everyone giggled.
Not mean giggles. Understanding giggles.
The shape blinked.
It wasn’t in charge anymore.
No one took its place.


PAGE 9 — WHAT THEY LEARNED
(Final E(sus2) — open ending)
Circle said, “Being loud doesn’t make you right.”
Square said, “Being sure doesn’t mean being kind.”
Triangle said, “We don’t need someone to decide for us.”
The Between-Place glowed wide.


PAGE 10 — ENDING PAGE
THE END — AND ALSO NOT THE END.
Sometimes, a voice will sound very sure.
You don’t have to fight it. You don’t have to copy it.
You can just slow down… and let the Between-Place stay open.
That’s how the bridge keeps growing.
